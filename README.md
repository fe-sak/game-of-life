## About this project

In 1970, mathematician John Conway created a cellular automaton named "Game of Life". It simulates the development of a life form on a 2d space grid. Each square represents a life, or as called by Conway, a cell. 

This webpage aims to recreate the Game of Life, allowing users to create an initial grid state and watch the behavior of the system through time

### Why?

I was inspired the moment I saw this automaton while watching [The Art of Code](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6avJHaC3C2U&t=34s) and decided to build a interactive system for people to play with

## Functionalities

- Click to toggle cells
- Draw to toggle cells
- Run simulation
- Pause simulation
- Retrocede one generation (simulation must be paused to retrocede)
- Advance one generation (simulation must be paused to advance)
- Choose simulation speed using the slider
